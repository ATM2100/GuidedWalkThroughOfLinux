a) print your working directory  
b) list all the contents of the directory  
c) then change your directory to the `basicDirectory`   
d) list the contents of the directory  
e) print your working directory.
```

pwd

b)
ls
ls -a
ls -al

### Find in Man Page 1
What does the man page say that the `-a` flag does for the command `ls`? What about the `-l` flag?

```
-a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

-l     use a long listing format

```
